# ASCII Maze
A command line program that lets you create random mazes. The mazes are text based, and only made with ASCII characters. They can be scaled to whatever size you want, and saved to a file, if you add the argument "-file". I came up with the algorithm myself. It may take a while to create depending on the size.

## How to Run

Set your size here in Panel.java and compile the program, then run it in the command line.
```
ASCIIConverter.dimension = new Dimension(40, 80);
```
